# You are given a string str. Your task is to find the number of checks that is not satisfied by the string str by checking the validation of the string str 
# if it's a strong password or not. A password is a strong password only if:
# It contains at least 6 characters and at most 22 characters.
# It must contain at least one uppercase character.
# It must contain at least one lowercase character.
# It must contain at least two special characters (@, I, &, ^,%,",#).
# It must contain at least one numeric value.
# It must not contain any two same consecutiveÂ character.
# Input Format:
# The input consists of a single line: The first line contains a string str. 
# The input will be read from the STDIN by the candidate.
# Output Format:
# Print the number that represents the number of checks that is not satisfied by the str.
# The output will be matched to the candidate's output printed on the STDOUT.
